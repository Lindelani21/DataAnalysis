1. Handling Missing Data
Identify all columns with missing values in the dataset. Suggest and implement two different techniques to handle missing values for each of these columns. Compare the effects of each technique.
2. Duplicate Detection and Handling
Write a Python script to identify duplicate rows in the dataset. What criteria should be used to detect duplicates? Explain why duplicates might appear in real-world data.
3. Categorical Data Standardization
The "City" and "Gender" columns contain inconsistent values. Write a Python function to detect and correct inconsistencies in these categorical columns, ensuring uniformity.
4. Outlier Detection and Handling
Identify the outliers in the Salary and Purchase_Amount columns using both the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method and Z-score Method. How do the results compare? Propose a suitable strategy for handling these outliers.
5. Feature Engineering
Create a new column, Age_Group, that categorizes customers into age groups: Young (18-30), Middle-Aged (31-50), and Senior (51 and above). Provide a visualization that shows the distribution of customers by age group.
6. Data Transformation
Normalize the Purchase_Amount column using both Min-Max Scaling and Standardization (Z-score Normalization). Plot histograms before and after transformation to illustrate the effects.
7. Encoding Categorical Variables
Convert all categorical columns into numerical format using three different encoding techniques: One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, and Target Encoding. Compare the impact of each method.
8. Data Integrity Check
Write a function to detect and correct inconsistencies in the Marital_Status and Education columns. Document the issues you find and justify the correction methods used.
9. Data Splitting
Split the cleaned dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets while ensuring that the class distributions of categorical variables are preserved. Explain the importance of maintaining the class distribution.
10. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate at least three insightful visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to analyze relationships between variables in the dataset. Provide a summary of your findings.
