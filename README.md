# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the Data Analysis Projects repository! This repository contains various data cleaning and preprocessing projects that demonstrate techniques for transforming raw data into clean and usable datasets. Each project showcases different methods and tools used in the data cleaning process.

## Introduction

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline. It involves handling missing values, correcting errors, normalizing data, encoding categorical variables, and more. This repository provides practical examples and code snippets to help you understand and apply these techniques.
The projects in this repository are developed from datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), for some I used python script files and there are some where I utilised jupyter notebooks instead but all the projects use python.

Each project contains a README that explains the project
